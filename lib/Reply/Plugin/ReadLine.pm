=head1 SYNOPSIS

  ; .replyrc
  [ReadLine]
  history_file = '.hist'
  history_length = 100

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin uses L<Term::ReadLine> to read lines from the user. This enables
useful features such as line editing and command history. The history will be
persisted between runs, by default in C<.reply_history> in your application
data directory, although this is changeable with the C<history_file> option. To
limit the number of lines written to this file, you can use the
C<history_length> option. Setting a C<history_length> of C<0> will disable
writing history to a file entirely.

NOTE: you probably want to install a reasonable L<Term::ReadLine> backend in
order for this plugin to be very useful. L<Term::ReadLine::Gnu> is highly
recommended if possible.
