=head1 SYNOPSIS

  ; .replyrc

  default_package = My::Scratchpad

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin persists the state of the current package between lines. This
allows lines such as C<package Foo;> in the Reply shell to do what you'd
expect. The C<default_package> configuration option can also be used to set the
initial package to use when Reply starts up.
