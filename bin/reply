=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script runs the L<Reply> shell. It looks for a configuration file in
C<.replyrc> in your home directory, and will generate a basic configuration for
you if that file does not exist.

See the L<Reply> documentation for more information about using and configuring
this program.
